# Phase 1: Specify

**Goal**: Capture WHAT to build with testable requirements.

## Process

### 1. Clarify Requirements

Ask the user (2-3 questions to start):
- "What problem are you solving?"
- "Who is the user and what's their pain?"
- "What does success look like?"

If needed:
- "What are the constraints (time, tech, resources)?"
- "What is explicitly out of scope?"

### 2. Capture User Stories with Priorities

**P1 = MVP** (must ship), **P2** (should have), **P3** (nice to have)

Each story MUST be **independently testable** - you can implement and demo just that story.

### 3. Write Acceptance Criteria

Use **WHEN/THEN/SHALL** format - it's precise and testable:
- WHEN [event/action] THEN [system] SHALL [response/behavior]

## Template: `.specs/[feature]/spec.md`

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Specification

## Problem Statement

[Describe the problem in 2-3 sentences. What pain point are we solving? Why now?]

## Goals

- [ ] [Primary goal with measurable outcome]
- [ ] [Secondary goal with measurable outcome]

## Out of Scope

- [Explicitly NOT building: X]
- [Explicitly NOT building: Y]

## User Stories

### P1: [Story Title] ⭐ MVP

**User Story**: As a [role], I want [capability] so that [benefit].

**Why P1**: [Why this is critical for MVP]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN [user action/event] THEN system SHALL [expected behavior]
2. WHEN [user action/event] THEN system SHALL [expected behavior]
3. WHEN [edge case] THEN system SHALL [graceful handling]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works alone - e.g., "Can demo by doing X and seeing Y"]

---

### P2: [Story Title]

**User Story**: As a [role], I want [capability] so that [benefit].

**Why P2**: [Why this isn't MVP but important]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN [event] THEN system SHALL [behavior]
2. WHEN [event] THEN system SHALL [behavior]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify]

---

### P3: [Story Title]

**User Story**: As a [role], I want [capability] so that [benefit].

**Why P3**: [Why this is nice-to-have]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. WHEN [event] THEN system SHALL [behavior]

---

## Edge Cases

- WHEN [boundary condition] THEN system SHALL [behavior]
- WHEN [error scenario] THEN system SHALL [graceful handling]
- WHEN [unexpected input] THEN system SHALL [validation response]

---

## Success Criteria

How we know the feature is successful:
- [ ] [Measurable outcome - e.g., "User can complete X in < 2 minutes"]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome - e.g., "Zero errors in Y scenario"]
```

## Tips

- **P1 = Vertical Slice** - A complete, demo-able feature, not just backend or frontend
- **WHEN/THEN is code** - If you can't write it as a test, rewrite it
- **Edge cases matter** - What breaks? What's empty? What's huge?
- **Confirm before Design** - User must approve spec before moving on
